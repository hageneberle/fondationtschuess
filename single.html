      <p>Single is not a theoretical treatise; it just uses clips to show how a single is produced. 
      The song is Time to Love, the singers call themselves Witchcraft. Also involved are the composer, arranger, producer, the studio musicians and later on the strings.<br>

      At the beginning the off camera narrator points out a scandalous discrepancy. The film crew spent two days in the recording studio observing a three minute piece of music being produced. 
      The film itself condenses the duration of production: 15 minutes into the film, the narrator announces that the producers are satisfied with the basic backing-track, after a four hour test. 
      After 24 minutes we learn that the crew has left the studio after nine hours filming, whilst work on the guitar tracks continued for some hours. […]<br>

      "Each product affects an individual air; individuality itself serves to reinforce ideology, in so far as the illusion is conjured up that the completely reified and mediated is a sanctuary from immediacy and life." 
      (Adorno, The Culture Industry: Selected Essays on Mass Culture, London, 1991) Adorno's cultural criticism was formulated in traditional terms. Single demonstrates that such arguments are in urgent need of re-vision.<br>
