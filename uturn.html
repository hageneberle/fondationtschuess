6 minutes 30 seconds (looped)<br>
Site-specific adaptation of single-channel audio work<br>
			<br>
		 	In this single-channel sound work six singers perform a political U-turn, a cappella. 
			Typically viewed as failure and weakness in politics, a U-turn — that (very) public moment in which promised positions are abandoned for a new, 
			contradictory stance — is abstracted here into elongated coughs, umms, and urrrrs which occasionally melodically cohere. 
			Undulating between dissonance and cohesion the six voices finally crescendo in a briefly triumphant harmony, before collapsing from their 
			apex into silence, only to re-start the indecision loop again. Resonating with ongoing collapses of political policies, past and present, 
			this work draws its duration from a 6-minute 30-second parliamentary volte-face in 2013* to consider the technical staging of language 
			and whether it is publicly possible, or permissible, to simply change one’s mind.<br>
<br>
As part of the site-specific adaptation the main entrance of the space at Sophienstraße was locked and visitors were redirected to enter through the backdoor instead.<br>
